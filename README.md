# junction

Library for working with [NTFS junctions][junction].

As opposed to symlinks, junction does not require [administrator privileges during creation][perm].
(*However starting with Windows 10 Insiders build 14972, symlinks
can be created without needing to elevate the console as
administrator*)[^1][improvement].

Quoted from [Computer Hope](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/j/junction.htm):

> A junction, also called an NTFS junction point, is a feature of the
> NTFS file system. It is pointer to a directory on the local volume,
> similar to a symlink. It can be accessed through the Windows GUI in
> addition to the Windows command line. Junction points were first
> introduced with Windows 2000 and NTFS 3.0, and are supported in all
> subsequent versions of Windows.

### Minimal Supported Rust versions

1.57.0
